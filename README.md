# Conway's Game of Life in C++: A Project Overview

## Project Description
This project is an implementation of Conway's Game of Life using C++. It serves as a practical introduction to the C++ programming language, including the use of vectors and matrices to create a dynamic simulation. The Game of Life is a cellular automaton devised by the British mathematician John Horton Conway in 1970. It consists of a grid of cells which, based on a set of rules, can live, die, or multiply. This simulation runs in a terminal and showcases the evolution of cell colonies over time.

## Key Concepts
**C++ Fundamentals**: This project introduces basic C++ syntax and concepts, making it an excellent starting point for beginners.  
**Vectors and Matrices**: It demonstrates how to use C++ vectors to create a two-dimensional matrix that represents the game's grid.  
**Control Flow**: The implementation covers essential control structures like loops and conditionals to simulate the game's evolution.  
**Terminal Graphics**: One of the unique challenges of this project was to display the game in the terminal, creating a pseudo-graphical experience using text characters.  

## Project Difficulty
The primary challenge in this project was devising a way to effectively display the game's grid within a terminal. This involved managing the terminal's cursor to refresh the grid display without flickering, creating an illusion of animation. Furthermore, implementing the game's logic required careful consideration of edge cases, especially when counting neighboring cells to apply the game's rules correctly.
